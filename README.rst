``snlc`` calculates semi-analytic supernova lightcurves using Arnett's
approximation that the spatial and temporal structure can be
separated.  It relies on `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_, `Astropy
<http://www.astropy.org/>`_, and `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_.

It was created for a University of Toronto transients class, and
likely contains bugs.
